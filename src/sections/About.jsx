My journey in the world of technology started with a fascination for crafting unique digital experiences. As a developer, I strive to transform code into tools that solve real problems while delivering an enjoyable user experience.

I specialize in building modern web applications with React, Next.js, Three.js, and other cutting-edge technologies. My goal is not just to write code, but to build impactful solutions that balance functionality and aesthetic appeal.

Beyond development, I have a passion for writing and design. I believe that good design not only enhances usability but also leaves a lasting impression. Through this website, I aim to share my knowledge, experiences, and creations with the community.`;
